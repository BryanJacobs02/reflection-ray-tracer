# Reflection in a Ray Tracer
*Final project for [MATH 384: Computational Graphics](https://bulletin.geneseo.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=22&coid=28681) â€” SUNY Geneseo*
  
  
## Project Intro/Objective
This project extended a basic ray tracing renderer in Python to support recursive reflections using vector calculus and reflection vector calculations. The original code rendered shapes with lighting and shading; my contribution added realistic mirror-like reflections on any object with a known geometric equation. Reflected rays interacted with existing lighting and shadows, creating more visually accurate scenes through recursive ray tracing logic.
